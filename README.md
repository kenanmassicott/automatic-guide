My First Repository on Github.
Websites are publicly accessible spaces where information is stored on servers, which are linked to the Internet for all to view. Each website is given a address line/name which serves as a locator so that other computers connected to the internet can access the information on the server.  That name is formally known as a URL. A URL consists of a Phrase of text indicators which when combined give each website a very specific address explicit to the information being hosted. Because all the information stored on websites and further onto the web is written/encoded in the language known as HTML it can be accessed by any computer that also reads this language. When I type in a URL into my Search browser my computer requests to accesses the websites through the Internet and further the information stored on the specific server. The information is located and then sent back to my computer in the form of encoded tags, which are read, and then presented on my computer in the form of Images, text, audio, and video. You have to write the information in a very specific way so that it is properly accessible across servers.
